# How to submit code

This is an early-bird version of MendeleyKit. We welcome your thoughts and suggestions. If you would like to make active contributions, e.g. code changes/additions:

- code submissions should only be made to `Development` branch via pull requests.
- you may create your own subbranches from `Development` and submit to it at will. However, if you want to merge it into `Development` then you would need to create a pull request.
- **Note**: code containing client IDs, client secrets, redirect URI will not be accepted in pull requests!
